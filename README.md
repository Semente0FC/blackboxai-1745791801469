# Enhanced MT5 Trading Robot

## Project Overview
The Enhanced MT5 Trading Robot is a Python-based automated trading strategy designed to operate on the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. This robot utilizes advanced technical indicators to analyze market conditions and make trading decisions autonomously. Its unique features include dynamic position sizing, enhanced entry conditions, and comprehensive logging capabilities for performance tracking.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and MetaTrader 5 installed on your system. Follow the steps below for installation:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install MetaTrader 5**: Download and install MetaTrader 5 from your broker or the official [MetaTrader website](https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download).

3. **Set up Metatrader5 Package**: Install the required Python packages using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

   ```bash
   pip install MetaTrader5 numpy pandas
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository or download the code files directly.

5. **Run the Robot**: Execute the script using Python. Make sure your MetaTrader 5 is running and properly configured to trade.

   ```bash
   python improved_mt5_robot.py
   ```

## Usage
To use the trading robot, you need to modify the parameters in the script as per your trading preferences:

- **ativo**: Set to the trading symbol you want to trade (e.g., "EURUSD").
- **timeframe**: Set to the desired timeframe ("M1", "M5", "M15", "M30", "H1", "H4", "D1").
- **lote**: Set to the desired trading volume (e.g., 0.1).

Once configured, you can run the script, and the robot will start trading based on the specified strategy.

## Features
- **Enhanced Trading Strategy**: Uses multiple indicators such as RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and ATR to determine trade signals.
- **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Adjusts trade size based on market volatility.
- **Logging Mechanism**: Comprehensive logging to track trades, errors, and performance metrics in a log file (`trading_log.txt`).
- **Take Profit and Stop Loss**: Implements a risk-reward ratio and sets appropriate SL and TP levels.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Includes mechanisms to handle various exceptions and ensure continuous operation.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:

- `MetaTrader5`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

You can install these dependencies via pip, as mentioned in the Installation section.
